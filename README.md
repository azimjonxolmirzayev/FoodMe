# FoodMe: Online Menu Platform for Restaurants, Cafes, and Kitchens

## Project Overview

**FoodMe** is a modern, online menu platform designed for restaurants, cafes, and kitchen services. It provides a seamless interface for restaurant owners to upload and manage their menus, generate QR codes for easy customer access, and enable customers to view the menu on their smartphones via QR code scanning. Orders are then placed directly with the waiter, simplifying the dining experience.

### 1. Project Name
**FoodMe** – A QR-based online menu platform.

### 2. Project Description
The system is designed to allow restaurant owners to manage their menus efficiently and customers to access these menus via QR codes without the need for physical interaction. FoodMe simplifies the ordering process, enhances customer satisfaction, and reduces operational costs.

### 3. Project Objective
The primary goal of **FoodMe** is to digitize restaurant menus and streamline the customer ordering process. By integrating QR codes, the platform offers a contactless menu experience, improving overall service efficiency and ensuring a hygienic dining environment.

### 4. User Roles

- **Customers**: View the menu by scanning the QR code and place orders directly with the waiter.

### 5. Key Functionality
- **Menu Management**: Restaurant owners can upload, modify, and delete menus.
- **QR Code Generation**: For each restaurant, a QR code is generated that links to the restaurant’s digital menu.
- **Customer Interaction**: Customers scan the QR code to access the menu and place orders through a waiter.
- **Security & Authentication**: Secure user authentication with OTP verification for restaurant owners, ensuring that only authorized personnel can manage restaurant data.

### 6. System Components
- **Frontend**: A mobile-friendly web interface where customers can view the menu.
- **Backend**: A Django-based API for managing restaurant profiles, menus, and orders.
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL database that stores user information, restaurant data, and order histories.
- **QR Code Module**: Generates QR codes dynamically based on restaurant profile data.
